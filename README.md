Welcome to Vapid
=================

Vapid is software that helps you build simple websites. It’s akin to other content management systems (CMS), like WordPress and Squarespace, in that it has two components: a public-facing website, and a private dashboard for editing content.

The gist of Vapid is:

* It does most of what you need, but probably not everything.
* You only need to know HTML (plus CSS and JS to the extent that your design calls for it).
* You should be able to learn the basics in a few minutes.
* Content and files that you’ve created here should be portable to your next platform.
